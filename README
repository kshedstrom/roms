Regional Ocean Modeling System

This is a branch of the ROMS code kept at myroms.org
(https://www.myroms.org/), containing sea ice and several other changes
people have contributed, notably the CoSiNE and COBALT ecosystem models,
a floats-like fish model and some ice shelf fixes. You are strongly
encouraged to register with myroms.org for access to the forum where
this code is discussed.

This ice branch can be obtained at:
https://github.com/kshedstrom/roms

Note: I have created a separate repository for my application files at:
https://github.com/kshedstrom/Apps

Some are also in

https://github.com/kshedstrom/Apps_master

The idea is that this should be a submodule of the ROMS repository.

Of the ocean.in files in the main code, I've been hit or miss on updating
things to be consistent with changes from my branch. The one to compare
to is in User/External/ocean.in which should be up to date.

Speaking of being hit or miss in updating, I seemed to have stopped
updating altogether, instead focussing on MOM6 development.
